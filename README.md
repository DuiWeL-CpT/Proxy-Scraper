# Proxy Scraper 
Proxy Scraper in Python 3 Using Beautiful Soup 4

This script will allow a user to choose which site they would like to scrape proxies from (currently only SSLProxies.org is supported). They will be able to choose from the menu they wil lbe prompted with when first running the script. 

When proxies have been scraped from the site chosen, the user will be prompted to enter the filename of the file to be created to contain the scraped proxy data.

The script creates a .csv file containing the proxy data. I will soon bring support for outputting to .txt files soon.
